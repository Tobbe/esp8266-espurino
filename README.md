# The ESP8266 Espurino project
This project is the temporary repository for the work in porting Espurino to the ESP8266.

The goal of the project is to take the source code of the Espurino project and add the ESP8266 as a properly supported "board"
which will complement all the other boards supported by Espurino.  It is hoped that few (if any) changes will be needed to the
base code of Espurino but, if necessary, these will be logged and requests made to have them incorporated into the core
code base.

When this project is completed, the work performed here will be merged into the full Espurino project resulting in no
new distribution of anything ESP8266 specific.   Instead, all that will be needed will be a download of Espurino itself to
allow ESP8266 users to take advantage of it.

There is an active Wiki associated with this project.  It can be found on [Wiki](https://github.com/esp8266-espruino/esp8266-espurino/wiki) page on the Github project.

The primary administrators of this project are:

* Bla≈æ Jugovic
* Neil Kolban
