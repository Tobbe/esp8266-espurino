# The ESP8266 Espruino project
This project is the temporary repository for the work in porting Espruino to the ESP8266.

The goal of the project is to take the source code of the Espruino project and add the ESP8266 as a properly supported "board"
which will complement all the other boards supported by Espruino.  It is hoped that few (if any) changes will be needed to the
base code of Espruino but, if necessary, these will be logged and requests made to have them incorporated into the core
code base.

When this project is completed, the work performed here will be merged into the full Espruino project resulting in no
new distribution of anything ESP8266 specific.   Instead, all that will be needed will be a download of Espruino itself to
allow ESP8266 users to take advantage of it.

There is an active Wiki associated with this project.  It can be found on [Wiki](https://github.com/esp8266-espruino/esp8266-espurino/wiki) page on the Github project.

This specific project (esp8266-espruino/esp8266-espurino) is the "best so far" copy of the code base that is being actively edited.   The sister project called (esp8266-espruino/Espruino) is the forked copy of the master Esruino project.  Only items ready for submission to the master should be editted and placed in there.

The primary administrators of this project are:

* Bla≈æ Jugovic
* Neil Kolban
